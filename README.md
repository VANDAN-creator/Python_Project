Life expectancy refers to the number of years a person is expected 
to live based on the statistical average. It depends on the geographical 
context of the area. Before the modernization of the world, life expectancy 
was around 30 years in all parts of the world. Life expectancy increased at 
the beginning of the 19th century but until there are the same countries 
while it remains low in the rest of the world.This shows that health 
standards are not the same all over the world. In the 20th century, this 
global inequality is reduced and similarly, life expectancy is approaching 
70 to 75 years and similarly no country in the world today has a low life 
expectancy than countries with high life expectancy in 1800.
